# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning 🩺🤖

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of breast cancer, utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various features.

## 🧠 Applied Algorithms

* **Decision Tree (DT)** 🌳
* **Logistic Regression (LG)** 📉
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🚀
* **Naive Bayes (NB)** 🧠
* **Random Forest (RF)** 🌲

## 🎯 Model Performance

After training and evaluating the models, the **SVM** algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of **97%**, outperforming the other classifiers. This aligns with findings from recent studies, which report that SVM consistently delivers high accuracy in breast cancer prediction .
